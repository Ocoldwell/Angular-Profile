# Angular Music App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.7.

This project was made using Angular as we learning the new library and this was the challenge we created.
We used the AudioDB API to display information about artists and their albums, with conditional filtering. Basic functionality is working along with styling using the Angular Material framework.

## Getting Started

Either clone the repository and run in a local server using ng-serve or go to the page [here]()

## Motivation

I made this for a weekly challenge on the Nology.io web development course.
It was also good practice in using Angular, Typescript and Angular Material.
It has google login setup via Firebase but no private routing yet, or functionality that I want to hide.

## Build Status

The website is functionally complete and the API is queried and shows information.
I'm fairly happy with the design and navigation features but plan to add other features at a later date, more filters in the search and cleaning of data.

- More filtering options.

## Built with

- Angular
- Angular Material
- SASS
- Typescript
